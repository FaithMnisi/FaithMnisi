### Data, Stories, and the Space Between: A Personal Exploration
I’m fascinated by stories that explore the unknown, whether through data analysis, books, films, or writing. Just as data reveals patterns and insights, I’m captivated by the hidden layers of meaning within narratives, be it through numbers, words, or visuals.

📚 Reading: I love getting lost in horror and psychological thrillers, captivated by the twists and psychological depth they offer.

🎬 Watching Movies: Horror films are my go-to, especially those that explore suspense and tension in unique ways.

✍️ Writing: I write stories that blur the lines between imagination and reality, often inspired by my favorite genres.
