### Hobbies and Interests: A Journey Through Shadows and Stories
In the quiet corners of my life, where shadows linger and whispers echo, you'll find me immersed in:

📚 Reading: Within the pages of gripping tales, I venture into worlds where darkness lurks and mysteries unfold. Horror novels grip me with their chilling suspense, while psychological thrillers unravel the complexities of the human mind.

🎬 Watching Movies: Within the flickering light of the screen, I immerse myself in the dark realms of horror films. I dissect their narrative bones, uncovering the subtle techniques that evoke terror and suspense.

✍️ Writing: In the silence of midnight, I wield words like a painter's brush, crafting tales that dance on the edge of reality. Inspired by my favorite genres, I weave stories that blur the line between imagination and the eerie truths that lurk within.



### Professional Goals

My goal is to continue growing as a data analyst, leveraging data-driven insights to solve real-world problems and contribute meaningfully to projects that make a difference.
